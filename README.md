# Weight-Balance:
 
This C++ program determines if a person's weight gain over a month is within a healthy or expected range. For each test case, it reads the initial weight (w1), final weight (w2), minimum and maximum weight gain per month (x1, x2), and the number of months (M). It calculates the minimum and maximum possible gain over M months and compares it with the actual gain (w2 - w1).

If the actual gain falls within the calculated range (x1 * M to x2 * M), the program outputs 1, indicating acceptable weight gain; otherwise, it outputs 0. The while (T--) loop allows multiple such evaluations based on the number of test cases provided
